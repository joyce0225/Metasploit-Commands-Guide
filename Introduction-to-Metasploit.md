# Introduction to Metasploit

The Metasploit Project is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute the exploit code. This exploit code can be custom-made by the user or taken from a database containing the latest already discovered and modularized exploits. The Metasploit Framework includes a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection. At its core, the Metasploit Project is a collection of commonly used tools that provide a complete environment for penetration testing and exploit development.

The modules mentioned are actual exploit proof-of-concepts that have already been developed and tested in the wild and integrated within the framework to provide pentesters with ease of access to different attack vectors for different platforms and services. Metasploit is not a jack of all trades but a swiss army knife with just enough tools to get us through the most common unpatched vulnerabilities.
