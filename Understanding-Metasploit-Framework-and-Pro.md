Metasploit as a product is split into two versions. The Metasploit Pro version offers additional features compared to the Metasploit Framework, but both share a core foundation. The Metasploit Framework is primarily a console-based interface that enables fast and efficient access to various exploit and attack modules.

The Metasploit Pro version includes features such as Task Chains, Social Engineering, Vulnerability Validations, and a Gui for easier access. It also integrates with tools like Nexpose for comprehensive scanning and data collection. Such features are designed to streamline the process of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities.

In this section, we will discuss the core functionalities of the Metasploit Framework and Pro versions, focusing on their key features, usage, and how they enable more efficient penetration testing. This will include a detailed exploration of the commands and modules available in both versions.
